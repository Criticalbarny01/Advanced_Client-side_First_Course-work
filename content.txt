Welcome, My Name Is Barnabás Horányi and I'm 22 years old. I come from Hungary, I have also lived in Montenegro for 4 years because my father
worked there.
I am a 2nd year student at the University of Westminster.
I have been developing websites for a few years as a hobby. I have had a few costumers in the past, but I'm studying computer science to
take my knowledge to the next level.
I'm also very interested in cryptocurrencies and solidity development.
During the week I also enjoy going to the gym. I also enjoy drinking a good pint with friends.
