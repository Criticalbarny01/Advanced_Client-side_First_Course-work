        <header>Linkedin HTML & CSS course</header>
        <p>This was an addition to our module that we could complete. It's a mere 4 hours long with the printing
            properties. The course was easy to follow and contained a lot of information which was very useful.
            I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to expand their knowledge on web design.</p>
